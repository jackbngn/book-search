# Book Search Engine

## Descritption

This project involves refactoring a fully functioning Google Books API search engine, originally built with a RESTful API, to a GraphQL API using Apollo Server. The existing application utilizes the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. The goal is to enhance the application's performance.

## Tasks

1. `Set up an Apollo Server`: Replace the exisiting RESTful API with an Apollo Server that will handle GraphQL queries and mutations. This server will bee responsible for fetching and modifying data related to book searches.
2. `Modify authentication middleware`: Adapt the existing authentication middleware to work with the GraphQL API.
3. `Create an Apollo Provider`: Implement and Apollo Provider on the client side. This will establish a connection between the client application and the Apollo Server, allowing request to be sent and recieved via GraphQL.
4. `Deploy the application`: Deploy application to Heroku, making use of MongoDB Atlas for the database.
